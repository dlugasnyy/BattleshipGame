# BattleshipGame
- four grids, two for each player
- the grids are square – 10×10 – and the individual squares in the grid are identified by letter and number
- on one grid the player arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent. On the other grid the player records their own shots.
- before the game, each pleayer sets their ships on the first grid. 
- each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. 
- the number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of the ship. The ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid). 
- the types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player. 
- the 5 ships are:  Carrier (occupies 5 spaces), Battleship (4), Cruiser (3), Submarine (3), and Destroyer (2).  

After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship. 
If it is a "hit", the player who is hit marks this on their own or "ocean" grid (with a red peg in the pegboard version). 
The attacking player marks the hit or miss on their own "tracking" or "target" grid in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet.

When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship's owner announces the sinking of the Carrier, Submarine, Cruiser/Destroyer/Patrol Boat, or the titular Battleship. If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins. If all ships of both players are sunk by the end of the round, the game is a draw.

-first thoughts:
 - player should have their own ships
 - player should have 2 boards, one where he can see positions of his ships and second where he see hits and misses on an opponent board
 - player have some methods that can fire shoots and place ships
 - board should have some information about position of placed ships
 - game should contain 2 players and there should be a possibility to start a game and finish it whether there is a draw or one of the players had win
